# Superstore Sales Performance
In this Superstore Sales Performance project, I created calculation and visual charts to provide better insights into performance. I utilized Power BI and Excel for data cleaning, as well as to create measures and calculated columns.

## The Objective:
* **Dashboard Creation:** Identify the KPIs, design an intutive and visually appealing dashboardm add interactive visualizations and filtering capabilities to allow users toexplore the data at various levels of granularity
  
* **DataAnalysis:** provide valuable insights to business entities regarding teh effectiveness of their ssales strategies through visualization and charts
  
* **Sales Forecasting:** Leverage historic data and apply time series analysis to generate sales forecasts for next 15 days
  
* **Actionable insights and recommendations:** End goal is to share valuable insights and actionable information that can drive strategic decision-making and support the supermarkets goal for growth, efficiency and customer statisfaction 

## Visualization:
* **Sales by Segment, Payment Mode, and Region:** Displayed in a donut chart to illustrate the percentage area covered by each category.
  
* **Sales by Category, Sub-Category, and Ship Mode:** Presented in a stacked bar chart for easy comparison and understanding.
  
* **Monthly Sales Trends:** Line charts were used to visualize the flow of monthly sales for the years 2019 and 2020, as well as the monthly profit trends for the same years.
  
* **State Performance:** A filled map with bubble indicators was used to show the performance of each state in the United States.
  

## Dynamic Slicers:
* Slicers were utilized to filter data region-wise, covering Central, East, South, and West regions.

## Sales Forecasting:
* A line chart was used to map the forecasted sales for the next 15 days, based on each order date and the sum of sales predicted by the forecast model.

## Conclusion:
Based on the forecasting model, the sales for the next 15 days are expected to range between a lower bound of 1,215 and an upper bound of 9,333, with an average daily sales prediction of 5,304. Insights derived from the past sales performance reveal several key trends and areas for improvement:

* **Payment Methods:** The majority of payments are made via Cash on Delivery (COD) compared to online and card payments, indicating a need to build more trust with customers to encourage the use of alternative payment methods.

* **Product Categories:** Consumers predominantly purchase office supplies, which account for a significant portion of sales. The sales difference between office supplies and furniture is approximately 20%.

* **Monthly Profit Trends:** The profit in 2020 was higher only in March compared to 2019. However, from September to December, the profit in 2019 was higher.

* **Regional Performance:** The West region is the most profitable, while the South is the least. Therefore, targeting the South region with strategic initiatives could increase overall profitability in the upcoming year.

These insights provide a clear direction for strategic decision-making, emphasizing the need to enhance customer trust, focus on high-performing product categories, and implement targeted regional strategies to boost sales and profitability.
